SERVES 4 10 6

lama huge fan of meatballs
no matter what country
they come from. The best
ones | had in Mexico were at
the Mercado Juan Sabines
in Tuxtla Gutiérrez in the
State of Chiapas. It was a
cool afternoon just before
Christmas, and | had driven
into Chiapas from Oaxaca.
! was planning to eat only the
typical foods from the region.
When | saw albéndigas,
! couldn't resist; | had to have -
them. They were brothy, spicy,
and smoky from chile chipotle.
/ was so incredibly happy.
Because | love them so much,
/am also super critical of bad
balls. | have made thousands of
meatballs in my life and one of
the most important things that
/ have learned over the years
is you need to add fat and
moisture to the ground meat.
/ like using dairy because
it adds both moisture and
milkfat, which also tenderizes
the meat. | also add bread
crumbs to hold on to the
moisture and fat as the
meatballs cook and prevent
them from getting tough
and dry (and no one wants
tough, dry balls).
